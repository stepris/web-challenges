import React from "react";

export default function App() {
  return <HelloWorldArticle />;
}

function HelloWorldArticle() {
  return (
    <article>
      <h1>A fantastic new react app</h1>
      <p>This is the first paragraph of text</p>
    </article>
  );
}

/* Render an HTML article tag containing a heading and a paragraph to the browser. To do so, create a component called HelloWorldArticle.

Use the following hints as guideline:

- In the App.js, create a new function called HelloWorldArticle().

- HelloWorldArticle() should return an HTML article tag as a wrapper which contains;
 => an h1 heading
 => at least one p tag
 => Note: Add whatever tags you like, but the predefined styles are limited ;)

- In the return statement of your App function, replace the div with your HelloWorldArticle component.

- Once again, look at the browser and be amazed! */
