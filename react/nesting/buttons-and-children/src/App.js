/* React Nesting: Buttons and Children

For now, there is a Button component in the ./src/App.js which is rendered several times.

Unfortunately, all buttons show the same text; supposing that different buttons do different things in an application, this is not really a reuseable component.

Let's use the children prop to make the component more flexible!

Task
************************************

Switch to the ./src/App.js file and

1. in the Button component, receive the children prop as parameter; make sure to destructure it.
2. replace the "Click me!" text with the children prop (don't forget the curly braces {}).
3. in the App component, change the Button elements from being self-closing to have an opening and closing tag.
4. add text of your choice between the opening and closing tags of the Button elements (use different texts to see any difference in the browser!)

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations, you can now use the children prop to create really flexible components!

Notes
You only have to touch the ./src/App.js file. */
