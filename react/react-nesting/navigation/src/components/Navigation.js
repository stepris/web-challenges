/* 2. Navigation component
Let's do (almost) the same with the navigation.

Task: Outsource the <nav> into a Navigation component.

Create src/components/Navigation.js.
The Navigation should receive a children prop used in its return statement.
ðŸ’¡ Note that the nav does not have a className, so there is no need to add this attribute.
In the App.js file, import the Navigation component and replace the <nav></nav> tags with it.
Awesome! You are a true children prop professional now. Let's dive deeper! */



export default Navigation ({children}) {
    returns <nav>Hello here is the navigation</nav>;
}
